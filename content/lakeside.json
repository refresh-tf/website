  "description": "Lakeside is an old school highlander map made originally in 2010. Becoming an official map on 2011 Lakeside hasn't been updated once to address any of the flaws and problems, that's where we come in. In this project we have aimed to fix issues with map geometry as well as minor aesthetic and performance improvements while also adjusting some of the layout for a more modern TF2.",
