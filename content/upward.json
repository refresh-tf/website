  "description": "Upward is generally the first map most players think of when someone mentions the payload gamemode. \nBeing a major staple of both competitive and casual this map is beloved by all but its not without its flaws.

Refresh has corrected all of this while still maintaining the same map we all love. \nThe original map pl_upward was made by Valve",
