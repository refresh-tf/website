  "description": "Warmtic has been around a while in Highlander but we noticed it was getting quite low reviews from players in ETF2L's last poll. Most changes you'll see here aim to only improve gameplay, not change. Most hiding/perch spots have been left in. \nThe original map koth_arctic was made by Hannes \"Hanz\" Tirez. \nThe original map koth_warmtic was made by \"Popcorp\". \n The control point skin was made by \"Alistor\".",
