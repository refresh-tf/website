Our main target was to correct a lot of the loose decoration around the map commonly used as obstacles or cover by adding block bullet brushes to the aforementioned stacks or replacing them with brush made structures. Finally the geometry of the last point has been improved to match the visuals, in original Metalworks players may struggle with combat around the point as props are used to build up rickety ramps, in Refresh we have adjusted this to be a brush ramp allowing fights to be much more
